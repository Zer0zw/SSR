Critical Variables Manipulation (CVM):
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable claimManager, which will influence the transfer of stake tokens in Function stakeLP
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable valueHolder, which will influence the transfer of stake tokens in Function stakeLP
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable valueHolder, which will influence the transfer of stake tokens in Function addPosition
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable claimManager, which will influence the transfer of stake tokens in Function addPosition
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable claimManager, which will influence the transfer of stake tokens in Function claimValue
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable valueHolder, which will influence the transfer of stake tokens in Function claimValue
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable claimFee, which will influence the transfer of reward tokens in Function compoundHarvest
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable feeManager, which will influence the transfer of reward tokens in Function compoundHarvest
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable performanceFee, which will influence the transfer of reward tokens in Function compoundHarvest
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable performanceFee, which will influence the transfer of reward tokens in Function claimValue
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable claimManager, which will influence the transfer of reward tokens in Function claimValue
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable claimFee, which will influence the transfer of reward tokens in Function claimValue
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable feeManager, which will influence the transfer of reward tokens in Function claimValue
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable valueHolder, which will influence the transfer of unstake tokens in Function unstakeLP
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable valueHolder, which will influence the transfer of unstake tokens in Function unstakeAllLP
Function init is able to modify the value of Variable valueHolder, which will influence the transfer of unstake tokens in Function removeLiquidity

Rewards without Timedelay (RT):
Function compoundHarvest calculate the reward without considering the time delay of staking
Function claimValue calculate the reward without considering the time delay of staking

Single Liquidity Pool Reliance (SLR):

Omission in Status Update (OSU):
In Function stakeLP, the status of stake amount is not updated in the function
In Function addPosition, the status of stake amount is not updated in the function

Unsafe Verifications (UV):
Function unstakeLP does not verify the amount of staked tokens
Function unstakeAllLP does not verify the amount of staked tokens
Function removeLiquidity does not verify the amount of staked tokens

Unauthorized User Funds Access (UFA):
In function transferTokenTo, token transfer in line [746] is not under unauthorized funds access.
In function getToken, token transfer in line [765] is not under unauthorized funds access.
