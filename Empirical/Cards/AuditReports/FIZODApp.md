# Description
1. Potential Reentrance Exploit
    
    The contract makes an external call to transfer funds to recipients using the payable transfer method. The recipient could be a malicious contract that has an untrusted code in its fallback function that makes a recursive call back to the original contract. The re-entrance exploit could be used by a malicious user to drain the contractâ€™s funds or to perform unauthorized actions. This could happen because the original contract does not update the state before sending funds.
    
2. Potential Circular Referral
    
    The contract is using the `_setReferral` and `_setReReferral` functions to record referrals between users. The `deposit` function includes a check to prevent direct circular referrals, where a user cannot refer themselves `_referer` cann't be `msg.sender`. However, the function does not prevent indirect circular referrals, where a third user can refer the first user, creating a circular referral chain.
    
    Specifically, if User A uses the `deposit` function and passes User B as `_referral`, and then User B does the same for User A, a circular referral is established. This creates a loop within the `_setReferral` function, which can lead to unintended behavior, such as infinite loops and incorrect referral calculations.
    
3. Redundant Require Check
    
    The contract includes a `require` statement within the `_burn` function to check if `_totalSupply >= amount`. This check is redundant because there is already a preceding `require` statement that ensures `accountBalance >= amount`. Given that `accountBalance` is a subset of `_totalSupply`, if `amount` is greater than `accountBalance`, the code will revert at that `require` statement. Consequently, if the `amount` exceeds `accountBalance`, it would always exceed `_totalSupply`. Therefore, the `require _totalSupply>=amount` statement is unnecessary and adds extra gas costs to the contract execution.
