# Project Name
GSPI Club-project3

# Description
If there is no reward sent to the contract with the addReward function, the contract runs out of balance and locks userâ€™s staked SPI. There is no function to check if the contract has balance to pay-out rewards. There is no guarantee for getting back staked tokens.

# Root Cause
```solidity
// Add reward to the smart contract (must have approval)
function addReward(uint256 _amount) external {
	spiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
	emit RewardAdded(_amount);
}
