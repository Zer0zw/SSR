# Description
1. Withdraw Amount Validation
    
    The contract is missing withdraw amount validation in the `withdraw` function. The absence of validation may lead to revert of the method.
    
2. Redundant Staking Status Functionality
    
    There are code segments that could be optimized. A segment may be optimized so that it becomes a smaller size, consumes less memory, executes more rapidly, or performs fewer operations.
    
    The contract is utilizing the ****`staking.status` variable in the contract implementation. The staking status variable is used only to determine whether the staking element exists. There are variables that can be reused to determine whether the staking element exists. Hence, the `staking.status` is redundant.

# Root Cause
```solidity
// Withdraw Amount Validation
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(CALLER_ROLE) {
    SafeETH.safeTransferETH(_msgSender(), amount);
    uint256 totalReserveBNB = address(this).balance;
    uint256 totalReserve = DataFetcher.quote(PANCAKE_FACTORY, totalReserveBNB, WBNB, USDT);

    emit Out(_msgSender(), amount, totalReserveBNB, totalReserve);
}

// Redundant Staking Status Functionality
function stake(uint256 amount, uint8 stakeType) external {
    ...
    staking.status = true;

function claimPayout(uint256 index) external {
    require(staking.status, "Earn: invalid staking");
