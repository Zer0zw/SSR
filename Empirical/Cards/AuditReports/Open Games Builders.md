# Description
1. Redundant Pausable Functionality
    
    The contract inherits functionality from the Pausable contract, which provides features for pausing and unpausing the contract's operations. However, none of the contract's functions make use of the `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused` modifiers inherited from Pausable. Consequently, these modifiers remain unused and redundant within the contract.

# Root Cause
```solidity
// Redundant Pausable Functionality
// Function to pause contract operations
function pause() external onlyOwner {
    _pause();
}

// Function to resume contract operations
function unpause() external onlyOwner {
    _unpause();
}
