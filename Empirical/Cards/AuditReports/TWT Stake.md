# Project Name
TWT Stake

# Description
1. The principal deposit cannot be withdrawn
    
    The project's business logic is different from most DeFi projects in the space, as users' principal deposits cannot be withdrawn by any means. The only return users can get are dividend and referral rewards. Inexperienced and reckless users might miss the aforementioned fact when depositing their principal into the contracts and expect to get their principal back.

# Root Cause
Not Open Source
