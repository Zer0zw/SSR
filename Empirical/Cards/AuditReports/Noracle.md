# Description
1. Contract Centralization Risk
    
    The contract's functionality and behavior are heavily dependent on external parameters or configurations. While external configuration can offer flexibility, it also poses several centralization risks that warrant attention. Centralization risks arising from the dependence on external configuration include Single Point of Control, Vulnerability to Attacks, Operational Delays, Trust Dependencies, and Decentralization Erosion.
    
    Specifically, the owner has exclusive authority to set unlock times, manage investor and advisor roles, control budget allocations, and execute token transfers. This concentration of power can lead to potential misuse or arbitrary decisions without checks or balances in case where the owner's wallet is compromised, highlighting the need for governance mechanisms like multi-signature approvals or community voting to ensure a more decentralized and secure operation.
    
2. Allocation Overwrite Discrepancy
    
    The contract is designed to allocate tokens to specific addresses within different categories, such as investors, advisors, and airdrop beneficiaries. However, the functions responsible for setting these allocations directly assign the specified `balance` to variables `investorBalances`, `advisorBalances` and `airdropBeneficiaryBalances`, rather than incrementing the current balance. As a result, if the same function is called for an address that has already been assigned a balance, the new balance will overwrite the previous one without adjusting the total distributed tokens accordingly. This leads to discrepancies between the recorded total distributed tokens and the actual amounts allocated to each address, potentially causing misalignment in the contractâ€™s token distribution.
