# Description
1. Redundant Native Currency Transfer
    
    The contract includes a function named `claimStuckTokens`. This function is designed to transfer either native currency (e.g., Ether) or ERC20 tokens from the contract to the caller (`msg.sender`). However, there is a redundant piece of code that attempts to transfer native currency, despite the contract not being designed to accept Ether. This redundancy could lead to confusion and unnecessary gas consumption.

# Root Cause
```solidity
// Redundant Native Currency Transfer
function claimStuckTokens(address token) external onlyOwner {
    require(token != address(this), "Owner cannot claim native tokens");

    if (token == address(0x0)) {
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
        return;
    }

    IERC20 ERC20token = IERC20(token);
    uint256 balance = ERC20token.balanceOf(address(this));
    ERC20token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, balance);
}
