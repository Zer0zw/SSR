# Description
According to SlowMist, the GenomesDAO project on MATIC was attacked by hackers, resulting in the unexpected withdrawal of funds in its LPSTAKING contract. This incident is because the LPSTAKING contract of GenomesDAO can be arbitrarily repeatedly initialized and set key parameters, resulting in the malicious exhaustion of the collateral in the contract.
