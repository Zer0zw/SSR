# Project Name
Perpy Finance

# Description
The Social Fi project Perpy Finance was attacked. A hacker was able to update the contract and illicitly withdrew 58,489,594 PRY tokens. These were then transferred and exchanged for 41.895 ETH. According to Perpy Finance's incident analysis report, "this breach was made possible by an error in initializing the proxy contract for the staking liquid module, which was a fork of the staking vested model previously audited and used by Camelot. We overconfidently chose not to audit this fork, incorrectly considering it risk-free, a decision that led to this exploit.‚Äù
