# Project Name
YFValue

# Description
On Monday, August 24th, the team identified an exploit for the YFV staking pool that enables malicious actors to individually reset timers for staked YFV. This attack is not economically sustainable in the long run due to gas fees, but hackers could still delay YFV claims and inconvenience members of the community who have staked their YFV. A malicious actor is currently attempting to extort the team by threatening this tactic.
